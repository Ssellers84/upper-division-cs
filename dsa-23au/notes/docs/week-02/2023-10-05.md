# Week 2 - Day 5
3 October 2023 - Thursday

## Morning Session

* Ask for a note taker.
  * Take notes on who people are, what they say, what they are working on, what they are blocked by or would like help on.
  * Group us into major activities, and the times each one starts.

* Arrays and Linked List
  * When to use one or the other?
  * insert operation (graph constant time versus linear time)
  * remove operation
  * getAt

* Hashtables (HashMap, Dictionary)
  * Hash function on an array
  * Fixed (deterministic) but evenly distributed
  * A perfect hashing scheme
  * Collision

* Composing Data Structures
  * Queue from a Linked List
  * Stack from an Array
  * Hashtable

* Our Goal is
  * view our issues and pull requests (how do we connect them?)
  * to Give Code Reviews and have conversations on threads
  * Merge, Commit, and Push
  * Give our Teammates the Opportunity to Practice
  * Close and Delete Private Forks / Unused Workspaces
  * To Open a Fresh GitPod and be able to run Maven, Commit, and Push
  * Split up into groups to parallelize

## Afternoon Session

* The three-lines Yes-And Code-Improv Exercise
  * Each person adds only three lines, including comments to a file
  * They create a pull request describing what they think needs to be done next, and what the overall goal is.
  * They assign as reviewer another person, who repeats this exercise
  * Can be used to recreate a previous project e.g. "array-links-2" to work on from scratch
  * Gives all team members a chance to write different parts of the code

* Start a stacks-queues project 
* Start a hashtable project.
* Enable GitHub Actions to build maven projects on commit and run unit tests.
