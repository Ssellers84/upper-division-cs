# Week 2 - Day 3
2 October 2023 - Monday

## Hacktoberfest

A good way to learn about open source, hacker culture, using version control like GitHub with
pull requests, and communicating with other programmers. We'll be participating as a class
during the month of October to reinforce the skills we are already learning, with also the chance
to win some prizes and have trees planted in the world.

You can optionally substitute work on your four pull requests for any of the weekly Java programming
assignments during October.

You can choose an open source project in the language you are learning (Java for most students) that you
are already a user of, or that you find interesting and would like to try.

(You can search through the algorithms already implemented, and find a new one in one of your textbooks
that you can add to the shared online collection.)
