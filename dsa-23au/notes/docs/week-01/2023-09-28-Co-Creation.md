## Add your five sentences and your pair programing partner's 5 sentences below

During the change maker lab this tuesday we outlined a plan for the 28th.
In a group, we will visit A local business & do root cause analysis.
At our business of choice, we will interview the owner/ workers about problems 
that they face.
We will then follow up by asking "Why" 5 times. 
This is done to give us an idea of the problems underlying cause.

In the Changemaker's introduction on Tuesday, we learned about techniques for
building and organizing effective, socially beneficial companies. One of the 
keys to running an effective and socially beneficial business is to promote an 
inclusive, creative environment in the workplace which allows everyone's vision 
for the future of the company to impact overall strategy. We learned that
complex system emerge out of the chaos of nature through self-organization. The 
Changemakers lab is designed to foster this sort of horizontal self-organization
rather than a top-down teacher-student hierarchy. We will imitate this
sort of structure in DSA as well in our teams and pair programming.
